// Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

// Symbol       Value
// I             1
// V             5
// X             10
// L             50
// C             100
// D             500
// M             1000

// Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. 
// However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV.
// Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. 
// The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. 
// There are six instances where subtraction is used:

// Example 1

// Input: s = "LVIII"
// Output: 58
// Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

// Example 2


// Input: s = "III"
// Output: 3
// Explanation: III = 3.
