// Variables needed: 
// --output variable which is total amount of $
// --deposit variable for incrementing during a loop
// --ifMonday variable

// -----Ways to solve:
// loop through n, or the amount of days.
// during our loop add the deposit to our total amount var
// conditional, if it's monday,(modulus?), incrememnt ifMonday var by 1
// also if its monday, set the deposit amount to newMon
